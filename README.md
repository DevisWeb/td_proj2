# Td_Proj2 - Create a PHP Quiz App
App to quiz on basic addition

## Description
##### Functionality:

1. Starting point:
    * starts with a question (e.g. “What is 48 * 12?”) 
    * lists three answer choices below the question
1. Evaluate answer
    * If correct answer is picked app toasts “Correct!”
    * else toasts “Incorrect”

    * Once all questions have been answered, app displays final score

##### Sources:
question bank is provided
##### Goal for "exceeds" rating:
dynamically create the questions/answers (make question bank obsolete)

## Instructions for developing the project:
1. User Interface
    - [ ] Create user interface of application using provided css. 
    - [ ] Make sure buttons are used and function correctly (e.g. ‘Submit” button will submit answer for evaluation).
1. Functionality
    - [ ] The application functions correctly, with answers properly marked as correct or incorrect. 
    - [ ] Make sure questions do not repeat themselves until question bank has been exhausted. 
    - [ ] Provided answers are reasonable based on the question asked.
1. Questions
    - [ ] Show which question user is on (example: Question 2 of 10). 
    - [ ] Shuffle the questions so the quiz is in a different order each time the user takes the quiz. 
    - [ ] Shuffle the answers so that the correct answer is not in the same place each time.
1. Toasts
    - [ ] Use and display appropriate “toasts” for both correct and incorrect answers.
1. Final step
    - [ ] Show the final score.
    - [ ] Before submitting project for review, check off all items on Student Project Submission Checklist. 

## Extra Credit
##### 3 steps to get "exceeds" rating:
- [ ] Add a non-white background color, and a contrasting color for the quiz elements while maintaining readability.
- [ ] Questions are repetitive. Enhance the app to dynamically create the questions/answers (--> make provided question bank obsolete). 
    - [ ] Please keep the difficulty of the questions reasonable (they should not be more complex than those provided in the questions bank).
- [ ] When quiz is complete, give the option to start the quiz again.
